      <br />
      <p>
        I’m a software developer, lucky enough to love what I do for living,
        specialist in server-side applications and did some client-side
        applications using React. Passionate for new technologies, and always
        trying to implement and document what I've learned.
      </p>
      <p>
        I feel myself in a constant search for pragmatic solutions. Not one for
        tradition, striving for innovation, while helping those around me to
        with product requirements.
      </p>

        Tools and Technologies: Java, JavaScript, Git, Maven, Npm, SQL, Spring
        Boot Frameworks (Web, Data, Security, ..), React.js (Redux, Axios,
        Router, ..).
      </p>
    </div>
